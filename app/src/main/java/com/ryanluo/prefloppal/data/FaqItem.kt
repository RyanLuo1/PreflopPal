                <b>Set Limits:</b> Decide beforehand how much you're willing to lose in a session and stick firmly to that limit.<br><br>
                
                <b>Play Within Your Means:</b> Avoid risking your entire bankroll in one game or hand. A common rule of thumb is to only risk 1-2% of your bankroll per session.<br><br>
                
                Following these guidelines helps protect your bankroll and keeps you in the game longer, even during unlucky stretches.
