# Heading 1 Preflop Pal

Overview

The Preflop Pal is designed to introduce new players to correct preflop play in Texas Hold'em poker. This tool aims to make learning optimal preflop strategies easier by providing a simple, user-friendly interface, in contrast to modern solvers which can be complex and difficult to read.

Key Features

Beginner-Friendly UI: Intuitive interface designed for players new to the game or to preflop strategies.
Simplified Input System: Easy-to-use controls for inputting hand ranges and positions, allowing users to focus on learning rather than navigating complicated settings.
Actionable Advice: Offers suggestions based on optimal preflop strategies, helping users understand when to fold, raise, or call based on their position and hand strength
Educational Focus: Unlike traditional solvers, this tool focuses on teaching players the logic behind preflop decisions, helping them build a solid foundation for post-flop play.
Visual Hand Ranges: Color-coded hand ranges make it easy to understand which hands to play in various positions without needing to memorize complex charts.


Getting Started

Install the Application: Download and install the Preflop Pal
Input Hand: Enter your hole cards using the simple input feature.
Choose Your Position: Select your position at the table (e.g., small blind, big blind, early position, etc.).
Learn and Practice: The system will guide you through what action to take (raise, fold, call) based on optimal preflop strategy from modern solvers for your position and hand.
Adjust Settings: Customize settings to simulate different game scenarios, such as number of players, stakes, or common table tendencies. (Still in Progress)

Why Use This Tool?

Modern poker solvers, while powerful, are often too complex for beginner players to effectively use. The Preflop Pal distills essential preflop strategies into a format that’s easy to understand and implement. This makes learning poker more approachable, while still providing valuable insights into correct play.

Future Plans

Hand Range Customization: Allow users to input custom hand ranges for advanced learning. (NodeLocking for specific user playstyles such as LAG, TAG, Tight-Passive, etc)
Opponent Profiling: Add features for simulating common opponent tendencies to refine strategies.
Post-Flop Integration: Expanding to cover early post-flop play as a continuation of preflop strategies.
